# Bedforce

## Description

`Bedforce` is a Spigot plugin designed to enhance the bed-related mechanics in Minecraft.
It introduces a new command `/bedforce` (alias: `/bdf`), which allows players to change the time to morning instantly,
bypassing the need for all players to be in bed, as long as it is night and the player executing the command is holding
a bed. The motivation for this project is adding a convenient way to skip nights without disrupting game balance.

## Features

- Introduces `/bedforce` command with an alias `/bdf` to instantly change the time to morning during night if the player
is holding a bed.

## Installation (WIP)

1. Download the `bedforce.jar` from the Releases page.
2. Place the downloaded `.jar` file into your Minecraft server's `plugins` directory.
3. Start or restart your server.
